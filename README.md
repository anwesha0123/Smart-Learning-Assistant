# ü§ñ Smart Learning Assistant: A Multifunctional RAG Chatbot  

## üìå Project Overview  
**Smart Learning Assistant** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot designed to help students and researchers process complex documents more efficiently.  
Users can upload research papers, textbooks, or study materials, and the system will:  
- Extract and summarize text  
- Answer questions contextually  
- Provide semantic similarity search for related content  
- Offer multilingual support  

By integrating RAG with NLP functionalities like summarization, translation and semantic search, the chatbot serves as a personalized, intelligent study companion.

## üîé Approach  
The development pipeline follows these steps:  

1. **Document Upload & Text Extraction**  
   - Users upload PDFs, text files, or other supported documents.  
   - Text is extracted and cleaned using tools like **PyMuPDF**.  

2. **Chunking & Embedding**  
   - Documents are split into smaller text chunks using a **Text Splitter**.  
   - Each chunk is embedded using **Sentence-BERT**.  
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database (**FAISS**).  

3. **Summarization**  
   - Summaries generated with **BART**.  
   - Summaries can be translated into multiple languages using **NLLB**.  

4. **Semantic Similarity Search**  
   - User queries retrieve the **most relevant document chunks** based on embeddings.  

5. **Question Answering with RAG**  
   - Retrieved context + user query ‚Üí passed to an **LLM** (LLaMA).  
   - RAG ensures **context-aware, accurate answers**.  

6. **Chatbot Interface**  
   - Chat UI where users can:  
     - Ask questions  
     - View document summaries  
     - Switch languages  
     - Explore related documents
